I have a strong experience in software development.

For 25 years I am leading projects as Technical Project Leader and 15+ years as Head of the development team in embedded and web applications.

The quality of the software is for me a priority: in Viseca the overall releasability of the projects has increased since I have introduced the automated process and controls; in Schindler the MTBF is passed from 2 to 12 months.

I proposed and implemented the digital transformation and automation of the building process: all projects are using the shared pipeline, the quality of the software is increased and the manual deploy is replaced by tools. I also push for containers with docker and kubernetes, supporting cloud native applications.

I grouped different teams and align the strategy of building the software using the same tools and processes, enforcing the use of unit test (TDD).

I coordinated and lead complex projects, I solved many problems by analysing and understanding the root cause.

I love technology and aim to create added value for my stakeholder using my creativity and innovate tools and processes.
