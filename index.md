## Job experience
With 30 years as a **Technical Project Leader** and nearly 20 years as a **Development Team Leader** in embedded and web applications, I have extensive experience in software development.

I **lead** a team of 30-50 engineers with an annual budget of CHF 4 million, focusing on technology-driven solutions that add value for stakeholders. 

My passion for **innovation** drives me to automate development processes and **standardize** infrastructure to improve software quality. 

I spearheaded **digital transformation** and building **process automation**	 across all projects, promoting containerization with Docker and Kubernetes to support cloud-native applications. 

I excel in coordinating complex projects, solving problems by addressing root causes, and working collaboratively in a team environment.

My mother tongue is Italian, and over the years, I have learned to communicate effectively with various teams and stakeholders in German, English, and French.
