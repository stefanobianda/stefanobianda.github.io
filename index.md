## Job experience
I have a wide experience in software development, with 30 years as a technical project leader and almost 20 years as a development team leader in embedded and web applications.

The team I lead consists of 30-50 engineers, and the annual budget is CHF 4 million per year.

I am passionate about technology and aim to create added value for stakeholders by using my creativity and innovating tools and processes.

I enjoy working in a team and am motivated to handle complex solutions in a professional manner.

I coordinated and lead complex projects, I solved many problems by analyzing and understanding the root cause.

Software quality is a priority for me, which is why I focus on automating the development process, standardizing the use of a shared infrastructure for the continuous improvement of the software quality of all company projects.

I proposed and implemented the digital transformation and automation of the building process: all projects are using the shared pipeline, the quality of the software is increased and the manual deploy is replaced by tools. 

I push for containers with docker and kubernetes, supporting cloud native applications.

My mother tongue is Italian, but over the years I have learnt to communicate effectively with the various teams and stakeholders in German, English and French.
