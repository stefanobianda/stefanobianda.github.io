# Software Development by R&D DT-COM

From  June 1992 to January 2001

## Description
Development of test programs for electronic boards and active participation in the R&D of Locarno's innovative SMART elevator concept.

### Engineer for Print Quality Technology
Schindler is one of the largest companies in the elevator market, and Locarno produces electronic PCBs for various types of elevators.

Schindler acquired the GenRad GR2756 to test its PCBs. 
This complex system connects measuring instruments to the PCB via a nail board, enabling the program to verify the correct assembly of components.

### Software Development Engineer
Schindler is working on a new elevator system using new technology and new concept. 
The main scope is a low cost and configurable elevator (SMART).

The development of the embedded core system is in Object Oriented (C++). 


## Main Tasks
- Project Leader with RUP methodology
- Define concept of Test Cases, Test Strategy and Test Agreement
- Backlog management
- Iteration development with campaign of manual test to improve the quality of the developed software
- Use Case Analysis and write the Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
- Object Oriented Design (OOD) with UML, generate code with Rational Rose 98
- Introduction of the new system GenRad GR2756
- Develop and assure the quality of the test program
- Generate the required file for the building of the nail board
- Work on the statistic program TRACS, control system on the repair of defective PCBs
- IT infrastructure of the team, UNIX and Windows NT

## Tools Used
- workstation unix
- PC WindowsNT
- shell scripts
- UML tool: Rational Rose 98
- OS: Linux Real Time with multi task
- Programming Language: C++
- Source Control: SouceSafe

## Technologies
- Basic
- C++
- Unix
- UML
- Code Generation
- SRS
- Test Case
- Test Suite
- Test Agreement

# Achievements

## Automatic data generation for the construction of the nail adapter
The contact positions on the PCB are processed by a shell script, transforming them into the necessary information for constructing the nail adapter.

## Implementation of the first test program on the GR2756
I am proud to have created the first test program on the GR2756.

## Documentation of software requirement specifications (SRS)
Documentation of behavior for a complex real-time multitasking project using SRS. 

Detailed SRS covering initial conditions, trigger, expected behavior, final condition, and alternatives for unexpected events.

## Definition of test aspects for continuous product improvement, test cases and test suite
Definition of Test Case, Test Suite and Test Agreement.

The software version tests are conducted using hardware simulators. 
From the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), we create Test Cases and categorize them. 
The Test Suite defines which categories must be tested for the software release (test, release candidate, official). 
The Test Agreement is the final document resulting from the Test Suite, completed by testers who execute the Test Cases on the hardware simulator.
