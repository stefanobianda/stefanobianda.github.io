# Schindler

## Working Period
From  June 1992 to January 2001

## Description
For my first job at Schindler, I was responsible for programming tests for the PCBs produced in Locarno. Right from the start, I handled the administrative part of the system. 

My passion for software development led me to change departments, transitioning to the development of the new elevator concept proposed by Locarno: simple, standardized, and innovative (SMART).

## Details

### At the begin
Schindler is one of the largest industries in the elevator market.
Locarno produces some electronic PCBs for different types of elevators.

To test the PCBs produced, Schindler purchased the GenRad GR2756.

The GenRad GR2756 is a complex system with many instruments.
The measuring instruments of the GR2756 system are connected to the PCB via a nail board.
The developed program uses a variety of measuring instruments and verifies the correct assembly of components on the PCB.

### Moved on R&D
Schindler is working on a new elevator system using new technology and new concept. 
The main scope is a low cost and configurable elevator (SMART).

The development of the embedded core system is in Object Oriented (C++). 
The core team is in Locarno, and we implement the project with the support of BBV.

I'm writing Software Requirement Specification (SRS) that define how the system must react on specific situation.
The code is implemented following the SRS's and with the SRS we also define the Test Cases.

We are developing iteratively and the iteration is 1 month length.

The tests are done with hardware simulator's. 
Depending on the new functionality implemented in the iteration, we define the test strategy.

All bugs are collected in a bug tracking system. 
We are managing the priority of the bugs and planing the fix of it.
