# Description
In my role, I'm leading different applications

Previously each application was developed in independent team.
Each team was free to use tools and processes.

After an internal reorganization, I take over the role.
The first aspect I did, it's a common approach and the use of the same tools

I have introduced the GitHub source control based on Git and migrate all applications.

The company decide to introduce the ITIL strategy and we start using ServiceNow

I'm enforcing the use of unit test, 
and in some cases the projects are using the Test Driven Development (TDD) process.

I'm setting up the build server with Jenkins and a first approach to a CICD pipeline.
