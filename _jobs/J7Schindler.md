# Schindler

[www.schindler.ch](https://www.schindler.ch)

## Working Period
From  September 2005 to December 2011

## Description
I came back to Schindler to be responsible for the entire software development of the BIONIC elevator. 

The team consisted of 20-25 engineers, the core team in Locarno (6), Ebikon (4-5), Stuttgart (6) and our partner BBV in Lucerne (4-8). 

The overall budget was around CHF 4 million per year.

I was in charge of planning all aspects of software development with one-month iterations. In each iteration, I had to plan the definition of new requirements, create a plan to implement the defined requirements by assigning the relevant tasks to various developers, manage the backlog by assigning bugs to be fixed based on priorities and objectives, define the testing goals of the iteration, and then prioritize the bugs found. Finally, I managed the finalization of the release installed in nearly worldwide, totaling approximately 70,000 installations per year.

The methodology I used was OOAD (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design). The code (C++ and C) was based on the UML model and generated by the tool itself. I oversaw the architecture, checking the SOLID aspects of the software and the design patterns used.

The adopted methodology, meticulous backlog management, and proper planning of iterations and releases have allowed me to significantly improve the quality of the produced software. The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) increased from 2 to 12 months.

From a personnel management perspective, I oversaw the Locarno team and, for several years, the Ebikon team. However, I made sure to coordinate with the Stuttgart team and the partner BBV regarding the scheduling of summer and winter holidays, all related to project timelines, milestones, and releases.


## Details
Head software development R&D of the most successful, most worldwide sold elevator of Schindler.

Thanks to my great team, we are extending the capabilities of our product.
We support different traction system, different doors type, double entrances, duplex system, 25 floors.

The software run on different hardware, for new installation but also for modernization.
The layer introduced has also allowed us to develop a windows application where it is possible to test the operation of the core software.

The main controller software and the Car Operating Panel (COP) are written in C++, 
the Landing Operating Panels (LOP) are written in assembler.

The common used protocol for the communication is the CAN bus,
exception are the LOP's that are using a proprietary protocol called Biobus.
