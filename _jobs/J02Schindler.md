# Description
Schindler is working on a new elevator system using new technology and new concept. 
The main scope is a low cost and configurable elevator (SMART).

The development of the embedded core system is in Object Oriented (C++). 
The core team is in Locarno, and we implement the project with the support of BBV.

I'm writing Software Requirement Specification (SRS) that define how the system must react on specific situation.
The code is implemented following the SRS's and with the SRS we also define the Test Cases.

We are developing iteratively and the iteration is 1 month length.

The tests are done with hardware simulator's. 
Depending on the new functionality implemented in the iteration, we define the test strategy.

All bugs are collected in a bug tracking system. 
We are managing the priority of the bugs and planing the fix of it.
