## Working Period
From April 2017 to August 2023 

## Description
In Viseca Payment Services and in Viseca Card Services we are developing different applications.

To have governance over the build process of the entire application portfolio,
I defined and configured the Jenkins shared pipeline.

The shared pipeline is developed independently of the project.
The project should manage 2 simple files and follow some standardization.
The files are:
- Jenkins file, where you specify the release of the shared pipeline and the environment to use
- config file, where you specify details of the project and which function to run

All new functionalities of the shared pipeline are immediately available to all projects. 
To use the new functionality the project should update the configuration file and update the release is using.

I'm manging the backlog of this amazing product.

I'm taking care of the up-to-date tools used by the shared pipeline (see [Tools](#tools-used))

The Jenkins shared pipeline supports different languages used by different stakeholders
- Java
- .NET
- .NET Core
- Python
- Typescript
- Images for docker

I am proud to have proposed and collaborated with the fantastic team of One to successfully achieve the goal of the first fully automated deployment in a production environment using Octopus Deploy.
