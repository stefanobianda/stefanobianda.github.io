# Viseca

## Working Period
From April 2012 to August 2023 

## Description

## Details
In Viseca Payment Services and in Viseca Card Services we are developing different applications.

To have governance over the build process of the entire application portfolio,
I defined and configured the Jenkins shared pipeline.

The shared pipeline is developed independently of the project.
The project should manage 2 simple files and follow some standardization.
The files are:
- Jenkins file, where you specify the release of the shared pipeline and the environment to use
- config file, where you specify details of the project and which function to run

All new functionalities of the shared pipeline are immediately available to all projects. 
To use the new functionality the project should update the configuration file and update the release is using.

I'm manging the backlog of this amazing product.

I'm taking care of the up-to-date tools used by the shared pipeline (see [Tools](#tools-used))

The Jenkins shared pipeline supports different languages used by different stakeholders
- Java
- .NET
- .NET Core
- Python
- Typescript
- Images for docker

I am proud to have proposed and collaborated with the fantastic team of One to successfully achieve the goal of the first fully automated deployment in a production environment using Octopus Deploy.

I am responsible for about 50 software engineers and several web applications.

Previously, each application was developed by an independent team.
Each team was free to use tools and processes.

After an internal reorganization, I took on the role of head IT Application Development.
The first thing I did was to align the development of projects and thus also the use of the same tools.

I introduced the GitHub tool as version control and asked to migrate all applications.
I also enforce the use of Gitflow as Git branching model.

The company focused on ITIL methodology and we started using ServiceNow.

I focused on the use of unit tests explaining the benefit of finding errors during build phase (shift left), in some cases projects used Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

I requested a build server with Jenkins and laid the groundwork for a CICD pipeline.
