# Viseca

![Viseca](/assets/images/L_VIS_MCV_A4_4f_rgb_1707.png)

[www.viseca.ch](https://www.viseca.ch/)

## Working Period
From August 2013 to March 2017

## Description
I was responsible for about 50 software engineers and several web applications.

Previously, each application was developed by an independent team.
Each team was free to use tools and processes.

After an internal reorganization, I took on the role of head IT Application Development.
The first thing I did was to align the development of projects and thus also the use of the same tools.

I introduced the GitHub tool as version control and asked to migrate all applications.
I also enforce the use of Gitflow as Git branching model.

The company focused on ITIL methodology and we started using ServiceNow.

I focused on the use of unit tests explaining the benefit of finding errors during build phase (shift left), in some cases projects used Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

I requested a build server with Jenkins and laid the groundwork for a CICD pipeline.

JIRA

MS Project
