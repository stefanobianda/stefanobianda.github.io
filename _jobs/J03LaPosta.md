# Description
I'm developing the International Online Application (IOA), 
the application is a digitalization of a manual process.

The companies that use the international bulk mailing have to compile a document manually.
The catalogue of the price of each category of bulk mail is complex and change regularly (at least for the new year).
The IOA is an application that the users can use and fill out the document online and produce the necessary PDF files.
With the login, we are able to identify the users and apply the specific catalogue of items and prices.

The catalogue prices are changing for different reason every year,
the IOA enable the preview of the new catalogues with the new prices.

The IOA use a Oracle DB to keep all catalogue items and prices.
I'm using EJB to collect the required data from the Oracle DB.

For the other application (see [here](#main-tasks)) I just collaborate with my great colleagues.
