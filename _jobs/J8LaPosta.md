## Working Period
From  February 2001 to August 2005

## Description
My interest in web applications led me to “La Posta”, where I had the opportunity to implement a web application in JAVA and JSP, using EJB for communication with the Oracle database.

The project, initiated by the main office in Bern, consisted of generating a PDF document with customer data. My collaboration with various stakeholders met expectations. Upon the implementation of the solution, there were performance issues, but thanks to my problem-solving skills, I was able to successfully resolve the problem.

Thanks to my predisposition for teamwork and collaboration, I supported some colleagues and suggested improvements to make their project more robust and with a high-quality.

## Details
I'm developing the International Online Application (IOA), 
the application is a digitalization of a manual process.

The companies that use the international bulk mailing have to compile a document manually.
The catalogue of the price of each category of bulk mail is complex and change regularly (at least for the new year).
The IOA is an application that the users can use and fill out the document online and produce the necessary PDF files.
With the login, we are able to identify the users and apply the specific catalogue of items and prices.

The catalogue prices are changing for different reason every year,
the IOA enable the preview of the new catalogues with the new prices.

The IOA use a Oracle DB to keep all catalogue items and prices.
I'm using EJB to collect the required data from the Oracle DB.

For the other application (see [here](#main-tasks)) I just collaborate with my great colleagues.
